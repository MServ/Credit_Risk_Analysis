# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis we used six machine learning models to calculate credit risk. The models were:
naive random oversampling, SMOTE oversampling, Cluster Centroids undersampling, SMOTEENN combination sampling, balanced random forest classifier, and Easy Ensemble classifier.

## Results
Note that all models used a random state of 1.

Model 1: naive random sampling
Balanced accurancy score = 64%
Precision = 
Recall = 
f1 score = 
Note the extremely low precision and f1 score values for high-risk loans.


Model 2: SMOTE oversampling
Balanced accurancy score = 
Precision = 
Recall = 
f1 score = 


Model 3: Cluster Centroids undersampling
Balanced accurancy score = 
Precision = 
Recall = 
f1 score = 


Model 4: SMOTEENN combination sampling
Balanced accurancy score = 
Precision = 
Recall = 
f1 score = 


Model 5: balanced random forest classifier
Balanced accurancy score = 
Precision = 
Recall = 
f1 score = 


Model 6: Easy Ensemble classifier
Balanced accurancy score = 
Precision = 
Recall = 
f1 score =
