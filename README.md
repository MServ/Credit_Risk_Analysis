# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis we used six machine learning models to calculate credit risk. The models were:
naive random oversampling, SMOTE oversampling, Cluster Centroids undersampling, SMOTEENN combination sampling, balanced random forest classifier, and Easy Ensemble classifier.

## Results
Notes: all models used a random state of 1.
       the extremely low precision and f1 score values for high-risk loans.

Model 1: naive random sampling
Balanced accurancy score = 64%
Precision = 99%
Recall = 65%
f1 score = 78%

## Summary
In conclusion, the model that performed with the greatest accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score was the Easy Ensemble classifier. This would be the model best suited to use.
